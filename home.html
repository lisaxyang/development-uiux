        <h1>About</h1>
        <div class="p">
          This project is a simple exercise in creating a React App.
          It allowed me to play and learn the React language for the first time.
          <br>
          In this project, I created an Electoral Vote Counter because this 
          project was made around the time of the 2020 election.
          I wanted to create a fun tool that would allow election watchers 
          to play with the states and predictions as they watch the votes
          come in.
          <!-- <br>
          This tool handles all the math for the user, and is also 
          meant to be a calming, non-partisan website that would allow 
          users to avoid the stress of the news. -->

          I hope you enjoy reading it; a lot of love was put into this piece. &#128522;

        <h2>The Goal</h2>
        <div class="p">
          This electoral counter tool is meant to be an efficient way of 
          following along with the election without needing a calculator by 
          your side and without needing to resort to news media to count for you.
          This non-partisan website features states displayed in cards, 
          with regional and political information, along with the number 
          of electoral votes the state holds. 
          <br><br>
          A user can filter the states based on region and political leaning, 
          and sort the states based on number of electoral votes. 
          They can also add these states to their vote counter, which will 
          automatically tally up the votes of all the states the user adds. 
          <br><br>

          </div> 
          <br>
          Users can, for example, choose to add all red or all blue states, 
          and then add any combination of swing states to see what the total is
          and what states their candidate needs to win to achieve what 
          number of vote counts.

          </div> 
          <br>
          This tool can also be used to give users a better understanding of the 
          electoral college. From playing with this site, users can also 
          see the power of swing states, and if any regions of the US 
          have a more homogenous political leaning.

            Aside: I chose blue and green for all the colors of the website 
            because those colors have been linked with feelings of calm and 
            relaxation and I thought that would be a good tone to invite 
            to a potentially stressful topic.

        <h2>Enhancing Usability</h2>
        <div class="p">
          For this website, I also wanted to make sure it met basic
          usability principles:
          <ul>
            <li>Clear wording with filters and sorting</li>
            <li>Clear hierarchy on the page</li>
            <li>Separation of displayed states from vote counter both in 
              hierarchy and in color
            </li>
            <li>Bold colors of buttons to indicate action item</li>
            <li>Red color of button to align with concept of 'removal'</li>
            <li>Bolded and colored sum in Vote Counter to indicate importance</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="note row">
          <div class="comment">
            Aside: I asked a family member to use the website without any 
            context to gather their thoughts, and they were actually slightly 
            confused by the sort options, so I made sure to rename my sort 
            and filter options to make it more explicit. Having an outsider 
            test the tool was very helpful in finding things that were 
            intuitive to me, the creator, but maybe not to a new user.

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <div class="p">
          <ul class="takeaways">
            <li>I had a lot of fun learning to use React. It felt like a more 
              efficient way to display websites because I could reuse 
              chunks of code, for example the card displays, instead of 
              just copy and pasting like I would in html.
            </li>
            <li>I learned that even with simple tools like this it is easy 
              to assume something is inuitive to a user when it is still quite
              vague. 
            </li>
            <li>I realized that data collecting - finding matching images 
              for all these states and the regional and political information - 
              is time-consuming and also just as important in creating a 
              usable app. For right now, there are just 12 states 
              on the website.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the future, I would like to have saved
              all the images locally, but for right now they link externally
              to the original site where I found them because the TAs suggested
              we do that since the images were not showing up if we saved locally.
            </li>
          </ul>
